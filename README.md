# Data-Science
Data Science projects created through my bootcamp with HyperionDev

### Finance Calculator
For this project, I have created a finance calculator. I assume that I have been approached by a small financial company and asked to create a program that allows the user to access two different finance calculators: an investment calculator and a home loan repayment (bond) calculator.

### Calculator
I have used defensive programming to create a simple calculator which can handle unexpected inputs

### Watch next
A programme that recommends a movie to watch based on the word vector similarity of a movie description the user has watched called Planet Hulk and a set of other movies.
